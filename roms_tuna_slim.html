		<p>On SlimRoms i use all latest improvements applied on Unlegacy-Android.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>all carveouts reserved for Ducati (the multimedia subsystem of OMAP4, responsible for hardware-accelerated video decoding, encoding and camera functionality) have been switched over to CMA</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<p>A few words for those who see CMA for the first time:</p>
			<ul>
				<p><i>
				"The Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) makes it possible for device drivers to allocate big contiguous chunks of memory after the system has booted.<br />
				The main difference from the similar frameworks is the fact that CMA allows to transparently reuse memory region reserved for the big chunk allocation as a system memory, so no memory is wasted when no big chunk is allocated.<br />
				Once the alloc request is issued, the framework will migrate system pages to create a required big chunk of physically contiguous memory."</i></p>
			</ul>
			<p>This means that a total of 996 MB physical memory is available to the system, while keeping Ducati fully working - this is a huge step forward, coming from the 694 MB available in the last factory image released by Google (Android 4.3).<br />
			While CMA was just recently implemented for this device, thanks to one of our developers (let's just call him Luden), it's quite stable: even under heavy memory pressure, the system manages to free up the required memory in order to start up Ducati and launch the requested multimedia functionality in a few seconds at most.
