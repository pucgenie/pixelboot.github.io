      <p>I don't have a donation address, but If you like to donate for my work, please directly donate to any Rom Project to keep our beloved roms alive.</p>
      <p>Another way to make me happy would be if you donate to an organization who cares about (kids having) cancer. I had blood cancer in 2001 (when i was 12/13 years old) and i am happy being still alive.</p>
      <p>A good choice of an organisation to donate to would be the <a href="http://www.dkms.de/en">DKMS</a> (they also accept donations via paypal), but any other similar organisation will be good too.</p>
